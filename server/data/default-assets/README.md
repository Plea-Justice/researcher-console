# `data/default-assets/`

Copy assets that will be copied to new users by default to this directory. Note that the assets placed here must already be published with `publish.js`. Thumbnails of these assets may be placed under `thumbnails/` with the filename as the base64 encoded path.

Subdirectories may be named by the asset type they contain such as `actor/`, `background/`, `clip/`, and `foreground/`.
